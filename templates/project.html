    <h1>Project Information - Plant Disease Detection</h1>
    <p>This project focuses on detecting potato leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. Below are the steps undertaken in this project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We collected a dataset of potato leaf images, including healthy leaves and leaves affected by early blight and late blight.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> The images were resized to 256x256 pixels and normalized to ensure consistent input to the model.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Augmentation:</strong> To enhance the dataset, data augmentation techniques like random flipping and rotation were applied to the images.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Creation:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Model Used:</strong> We employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is particularly effective for image classification tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Technologies:</strong> The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, powerful libraries for deep learning and neural networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers to detect features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and dense layers for the final classification.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset with an 80-10-10 split for training, validation, and testing data, respectively. The training was performed over 25 epochs with a batch size of 32.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics on both the training and validation datasets. The final model achieved satisfactory accuracy and was saved for deployment.</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>The trained model was integrated into a Flask web application. Users can upload images of potato leaves, and the application will predict the disease and provide a confidence score.</li>
          <li>The Flask application handles image uploads, pre-processes the images, and uses the trained model to make predictions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Technologies and Libraries Used:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python</li>
          <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib</li>
          <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Google Colab for training the model, Visual Studio Code for running the Flask application</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
